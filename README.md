# MoverScorePlus üöÄ

MoverScorePlus is an enhanced implementation inspired by the original MoverScore, as introduced by the AIPHES research group for evaluating text similarity using advanced natural language processing techniques. This project seeks to build upon the foundational work done in the [MoverScore GitHub repository](https://github.com/AIPHES/emnlp19-moverscore) by incorporating additional features, optimizations, and user-friendly documentation for broader accessibility and use in natural language processing applications.

## Description ‚úçÔ∏è

This project contains Python scripts leveraging pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Transformers library to calculate text similarity scores. Designed to assist researchers and developers in natural language processing, MoverScorePlus offers a powerful tool for evaluating the semantic similarity between two pieces of text with improvements in ease of use and performance.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è

- torch==2.2.0
- transformers==4.37.2
- pyemd==1.0.0
- numpy==1.24.4

## Usage üìñ

Follow these examples to use the scripts:

1. Clone the reposity into your working folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BSc-Thesis-Tamas-Tibor/moverscore.git
```

2. Use the package as follows:

```python
# Example usage of the moverscore.py script
from MoverScorePlus import MoverScore, MoverScoreConfig
config = MoverScoreConfig(stop_words=["<Your stopwords>"])

# Create the configuration of the score
moverscore = MoverScore(config=config)

# Create lists of the documents, please note that
# each string represents one whole document, therefore
# the number of elements in the two lists must match
ref = ["<Your list of reference texts>"]
hyp = ["<Your list of hypothesis texts>"]

# Call the moverscore
moverscore(ref, hyp)
```

## Test the score üìî

We provide an example notebook to test the score in [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KvG1L2kmd2Ptt_mvDeAzihvREaqJRWAJ?usp=sharing).
